# What is this?
Dwarf Fortress 13 is inspired by Dwarf Fortress game by Tarn and Zach Adams, using the SS13 codebase which takes the action not in space - but on the planet, in the world created by the blood god Armok. Play as one of the dwarves in the fortress, master the arts of craft and combat, build up the fortress with other dwarves to protect from the harsh outside world. But even walls can not always save you from those who lurk below.
